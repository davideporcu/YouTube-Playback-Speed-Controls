# YouTube Playback Speed Controls

I'm tired of browsing settings to change the playback speed of YouTube videos. 
So, I made this bookmarklet to add controls to the bottom bar (speed up and slow down buttons and a label to see current playback speed).

## Usage

You can add the bookmarklet creating a new bookmark with any name (e.g. YTSpeed) and [this](https://github.com/davideporcu/YouTube-Playback-Speed-Controls/blob/master/youtubeSpeedControls_bookmarklet.js) code in the URL field.

Press the bookmark to add controls, press again to hide them.
Use "+" button to increase speed of 0.1x and "-" button to decrease speed of 0.1x.
